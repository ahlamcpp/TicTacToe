# Tic Tac Toe 
This web-development game is a  project for [SEI](https://generalassemb.ly/) course at [Misk academy](https://misk.org.sa/miskacademy/) 
* [Play the game here](https://ahlamcpp.github.io/TicTacToe/index1.html) :checkered_flag:

## How To Play: 
The goal of this project is to make it possible for users to have a richer experience when playing TicTacToe. 
How? There are three levels: **Easy**, **Medium** and **Advanced** levels . 

### Easy Level: 3X3 grid :open_mouth:
<p align="center"><img src="./images/level1.png" width="300" height="300"></p>

When you play on a three by three game board, your goal is to win by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonally :clap: 
In case of getting a full grid without a winner, it's a Tie.. so try again! :v: 
The first player will be **X** and the second is **O**.
There is a countdown timer with only **30** seconds, so you need to finish the game within **30** seconds :exclamation:


### Medium Level: 4X4 grid :anguished:
<p align="center"><img src="./images/level2.png" width="300" height="300"></p>

Here, it's the same but with a 4x4 board, so your goal is to win by getting four in a row - either across, down, or diagonally :clap: 
There is a countdown timer with only **40** seconds :exclamation:

### Advanced Level: 5X5 grid :astonished:
